# Serve TTFT and scheduling benchmark

The runner sends public HTTP requests to an already-running `frinfer-serve`. It records the whole
stream: first output, subsequent output events, completion, errors and cancellation. Optional
structured Serve logs explain cache and scheduling actions. A separate campaign controller starts
a fresh server for each sample and records its effective configuration.

## Measurement contract

Request JSON and media data URLs are prepared before timing. Each request owns a preconnected
HTTP/1.1 connection:

```text
t0 = immediately before writing the request
tb = request body write completed
ta = first protocol acceptance metadata
t1 = first nonempty text, reasoning or tool-argument delta
TTFT = t1 - t0
```

TTFT includes body upload, input preparation, queuing, prefill and first output. HTTP headers,
assistant-role chunks, usage and empty deltas do not count as output. A failure before `t1` has no
TTFT; a later failure retains the TTFT already measured.

The trace retains timestamps and sizes for every nonempty output event, without duplicating its
text. It reports output-event gaps, terminal latency, the tail after the last output, and transport
closure. SSE events are not tokens: a speculative commit can emit several tokens at once, and
several frames can arrive in one socket read. Cancellation records the action and actual closure;
an unterminated stream is distinguished from a protocol terminal.

Four results are separate:

- **Construction:** the declared arrival graph and required external ordering occurred.
- **Request outcome:** success, rejection, cancellation or failure, including partial output.
- **Mechanism coverage:** diagnostics actually observed the required preemption, restore or other
  action. Zero is `not_observed`; missing evidence is `unavailable`.
- **Performance:** measured latency, output gaps, completed work and costs. A constructed case with
  high TTFT remains a valid adverse result.

Completed output throughput is successful-request usage divided by the workload makespan,
including time spent on unsuccessful requests. Missing usage is not replaced with byte or event
counts. Histories built from generated answers and pressure-triggered cancellations are marked as
conditional workloads; their observed rates do not establish matched-input throughput.

## Workloads and resources

[Case definitions](cases.py) own request graphs and their construction checks.
[Profiles](profiles.py) own exact server arguments. `--help` on the runner lists available
cases. Chat, Responses and Anthropic cases exercise their respective public protocols; Responses
cases also cover stored conversation history.

Device KV grows with executed work. For an ordinary request with prompt length `p` and output
limit `o`, `64 * ceil((p + o - 1) / 64)` describes its eventual page-rounded Main KV length, not a
reservation taken at admission. Shared content, partial-page COW, speculative peaks and state
slots must also be accounted for. The profiler's observed allocations and transfers establish
which resource actually became scarce.

The resource campaign covers hot continuations, changing private/shared working sets, interference,
two-session 64K swaps and six-session 55K rotations. Cases retain their workload names when an
older cache policy is replaced; the name alone does not prove a particular victim or placement.
`private-state-working-set-shift` retains the protocol's default automatic shared writes.
`private-only-working-set-shift` uses explicit mode with no shared markers to isolate private
continuations; use that control when comparing an older profile that disabled shared storage.

The preemption campaign contains the upstream preemption design, pinned off in this fork. The
runtime never pauses a resident, and every one of these profiles sizes its Main KV pool below
`max_concurrency × ceil(max_context/64)` (for example `--max-context 512 --kv-capacity 512
--max-concurrency 2`), which the compliant-pool startup validator rejects, so the server cannot start
and the graphs cannot run. `bench/README.md` records the campaign as pinned off.

| Case | Workload and evidence sought |
|---|---|
| `preemption-replay` | Two fixed arrivals grow beyond shared Device capacity with Host disabled; require actual preemption and replay. |
| `preemption-snapshot` | The same arrivals with Host capacity; require snapshot restoration. |
| `shared-growth-fairness` | Three shared-prefix branches and two short arrivals; measure waiting, pauses and replay alongside other progress. |
| `snapshot-history-cancel` | Retained history competes with snapshots; cancel a stream during observed pressure, then probe the history. |
| `vision-growth-replay` | Text and Vision requests grow together; require the Vision request itself to be preempted and replayed. |

Fixed-arrival graphs prepare bodies first and record planned arrival offsets and actual send
lateness. Token facts and reached output limits are checked against actual usage. Normal EOS is
retained, so an output limit is not a promise that the model will generate that many tokens.
Sampled phase overlap can miss a short replay window; an unobserved sample is not evidence of
absent interleaving.

## Run a campaign

The default artifact is `out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer`, with FP8 KV. GPU campaigns run serially.

```bash
# pinned off: the preemption profiles are rejected by the compliant-pool validator
python3 tools/bench/run_serve_ttft_campaign.py --campaign preemption --samples 1

python3 tools/bench/run_serve_ttft_campaign.py \
  --case session-hot-continuation \
  --case private-state-working-set-shift \
  --samples 3
```

`smoke` runs one short cold case, `resource` runs cache-pressure workloads, `preemption` selects the
five pinned-off graphs above (their profiles are rejected by the compliant-pool validator, so they
cannot start), and `full` runs all cases. The default is `resource` with one sample. Select
`--serve` and `--artifact` explicitly when using another binary or artifact. Fixture token facts
still need to match the selected tokenizer/template.

`--profile-config FILE` replaces the built-in profile catalog. This allows a preserved baseline
binary to use its own CLI without compatibility flags in the candidate:

```json
{
  "common_args": ["--kv-dtype", "fp8", "--no-thinking", "--greedy"],
  "profiles": {
    "cache-hot": ["--max-context", "8192", "--kv-capacity", "8192",
                  "--max-concurrency", "1", "--device-state-slots", "2",
                  "--host-context-mib", "0"]
  }
}
```

The controller applies a common one-second statistics interval, enables request logging, and
records these effective arguments in its manifest. Host capacity is a unified byte budget for KV
and state; when comparing a baseline with separate pools, match its actual aggregate backing.
`--device-state-slots` remains extra state capacity beyond active lanes.

Before loading servers, the controller stages the selected immutable artifact once under
`/dev/shm/ninfer-artifacts/`. It reuses that copy while the source identity is unchanged; insufficient
tmpfs space is an explicit error. Server warmup completes before measurement and does not populate
the logical prefix cache.

Each sample gets a fresh process. Results are written under the selected `--output-dir`, or the
normal `profiles/bench/ttft/` campaign directory:

```text
manifest.json
raw/<profile>/<case>/sample-NNN.json
progress/<profile>/<case>/sample-NNN.log
serve/<profile>/<case>/sample-NNN.log
request-log/<profile>/<case>/sample-NNN.jsonl
summary.md / summary.json / summary.csv
request-analysis.csv                 # per-request first-output attribution
failures.json                         # when a run fails
```

The raw client JSON owns external measurements. Structured logs own internal work and resource
observations. Failed and interrupted campaigns retain their measurements and produce the same
summary bundle.

Raw runs retain the actual request payload and assembled output text for offline prefix analysis.
After measurement, data URLs are deduplicated by SHA-256 under the adjacent
`<sample>-media/` directory; the JSON retains each item's type, encoding and relative path.

For an independently managed server:

```bash
python3 tools/bench/run_serve_ttft.py \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:18080 \
  --case shared-fanout \
  --profile-label shared-prefix \
  --request-log-jsonl profiles/bench/server-requests.jsonl \
  --output profiles/bench/shared-fanout.json
```

The runner does not configure that server; its profile label does not verify the actual settings.
It prints progress and five-second heartbeats to stderr. Exit success means the graph was
constructed; mechanism coverage and performance remain separate report dimensions.

## Interpretation and comparisons

```bash
python3 tools/bench/summarize_serve_ttft.py profiles/bench/candidate \
  --baseline profiles/bench/baseline
```

The report reads runs declared by the manifest and exposes missing, invalid and unconstructed
samples. TTFT groups retain raw samples, median, range and dispersion. Symmetric simultaneous roles
are compared by ordered observations within each run, rather than treating an arbitrary role's
changed admission order as a performance regression.

Client and server observations join through exact wire request/response IDs within a server
instance. Server request IDs then identify Engine work. Process clocks are not subtracted from
each other. Request statistics distinguish original prefill, replay, pauses, snapshot/replay restores
and transfers. Client cancellation can leave public usage unknown even when the Engine records
committed work; those counts do not establish that the client received it.

`request-analysis.csv` uses the server's
[`first_output_timing`](../../../docs/serving.md#structured-request-log) snapshot to partition
streaming TTFT into preparation, initial Engine queue, initial binding, paused time, remaining
resident time and HTTP residual. Each stage retains its duration and percentage of client TTFT;
the residual includes transport and publication outside the Engine boundary.
Admission columns retain the preferred reuse frontier, source-wait milliseconds, revoked checkpoint
count and fallback reason from Engine. Source waiting is already included in queue time. Historical
logs without these observations leave the columns unavailable.
Missing observations remain unavailable, and negative residuals remain visible as inconsistent
measurements. Aggregate responses finish at a different boundary and do not receive this streaming
attribution.

Separate columns report Host exposure, this request's prefill/replay submission, completion wait,
postprocessing and GPU stream intervals, plus completed context-transfer time and bytes. These
overlapping measurements explain work within the wall-time stages; adding them together would
double-count time. The per-case summary complements the full per-request CSV.

For a theoretical reuse bound, compare the actual prepared input with earlier committed histories,
including token, position, media and rewrite semantics. A matching prefix alone does not establish
that its recurrent state was saved. Distinguish the semantic bound from the deepest complete
checkpoint retainable under the case's physical budget, then explain the actual selected frontier.
Replay of the same paused request is additional work, not a cross-request cache hit.

Global interval statistics include background cache demotion, which has no request owner, and the
Engine's mutually exclusive Host work accounting. Device wait and detailed subsets must not be
added again to Host totals. The final shutdown interval completes the counter stream when its
marker is present. Legacy or incomplete logs remain explicitly unconfirmed.

Periodic resource occupancy is a **sampled maximum**. Only the allocator's actual high-water mark
is called a peak. Reserved destinations count against physical capacity while copies are in flight.

A comparison needs matching workload, physical budget, artifact, backend, observation settings and
hardware conditions. Reported eligibility does not itself establish that these conditions match.
Use repeated interleaved baseline/candidate runs for performance conclusions; preserve adverse
samples and failures. State precisely which mechanisms and workloads the measurements cover.

Exact state/KV contents, lease retirement, allocator geometry and cancellation at particular Native
transaction boundaries belong in behavioral and Native tests. HTTP measurements complement those
checks with real scheduling, protocol and performance evidence.
